INSERT into Lecture (Id, Text) VALUES(1, "If you have already worked on a programming project in group, you probably have encountered problems such as modifications by someone,
                        but you donâ€™t know who, or the impossibility to work on the same code at the same time. All these problems can be solved 
                        by a version-control system. And Git is one of it.&&<br>
                    <h3>What is a version-control system?</h3>
                    &A version-control system is a software mainly used by developers. It can track the evolution of a file and keep the old versions of it. 
                        But this tool differs from a backup software. Indeed, there are a lot of very useful functionality:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They can retain who did every modification and why</li>
                            <li>It is capable to merge the modifications of two users working on the same file at the same time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        To sum up, a version-control system can track the evolution of a code, can save every version of the file, and allows developers 
                        to work on the same file at the same time.<br>
                        There are a lot of different version-control system, like CVS, SVN or Mercurial. But Git is probably the most powerful of them.
                        There are two kind of version-control : distributed and centralized. A distributed version-control does not use any server.
                        Every developers own their own personal version of a file, and send it to the other as a peer-to-peer. A centralized version-control
                        uses a server where every version of the file is saved, and developers need to connect to the server to see modifications. But 
                        some of the distributed control-version uses a server to send the modification to the rest of the development group. And this is
                        how GIT works.&&<br>
                    <h3>And what about Git?</h3>
                    &Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is one of the most important version-control systems. Its goals include speed, data integrity
                        and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. CVS and SVN are older, and Git is probably faster and more flexible than the other 
                        version-control system.<br>
                        Moreover, it is possible to work with branches (parallel version of the same project) but the software is more intricate.&&<br>
                    &Git is a must-have tool in a programming project, because it has a lot of game-changing functionalities. A particularity of Git is the 
                        existence of collaborative website such as GitHub. This is a social media for developers, with a huge community. This is an excellent way
                        to participate in projects and ask for help.
